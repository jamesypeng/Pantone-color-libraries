# Pantone-color-libraries

Pantone color libraries as .acb files for Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator etc, downloaded with Pantone Color Manager in August 2019.

To use the colour libraries, copy the .acb files to the Color Books folder of the target application e.g. /Applications/Adobe Photoshop CC 2018/Presets/Color Books, /Applications/Adobe Illustrator CC 2018/Presets/en_GB/Swatches/Color Books or the equivalent C:\Program Files\Adobe\etc folder on Windows.

# Freetone

FREETONE by Stuart Semple contains 1280 colours including digital versions of his Pinkest Pink, Incredibly Kelinish Blue, Black 3.0 and TIFF.

A SIMPLE & TOTALLY FREE COLOUR PALETTE PLUGIN FOR ADOBE

That unlocks a whole books worth of very Pantone-ish colours.

1280 Liberated colours are extremely Pantoneish and reminiscent of those found in the most iconic colour book of all time. In fact it's been argued that they are indistinguishable from those behind the Adobe/Pantone paywall.
